This is a revised version of autodock.py, the Autodock/Vina plugin for PyMol
by Daniel Seeliger.  See "http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~dseelig/adplugin.html
for the original release.

The revisions made here are in an attempt to adapt this plugin, which works
well with Python 2.7.9 and PrMOL 1.7.x on Linux or Mac for use on Windows.
As of 28 March 2015, this version now appears to work reasonably well under
both OS X and Windows XP.  Further work and a proper installer will be needed.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Autodock 4:  Autodock 4 and AutodockTools 4 is a product of the Scripps
Research Institute.  To install this plugin, you first must install Autodock 4,
including autodock4, autogrid4, and vina.  See
http://autodock.scripps.edu/

2.  MGLTools 1.5.7:  You need MGLTools for operation of this plugin, also from
the Scripps Research Institute.  See http://http://mgltools.scripps.edu/.  The
plugin has been test both with MGLTools 1.5.6 and MGLTools 1.5.7 RC1.  1.5.7
is recommended.

3.  Python 2.7.9:  While portions of the Autodoc system come with an internal
version of python, it is helpful to have a system installation of Python 2.7.9.
See https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/

4.  PyMOL 1.7:  The plugin is a plugin for the PyMOL molecular visualization
program PyMOL developed by the late Warren Delano and not maintained by
Schrodinger LLC.  See http://www.pymol.org for the Schrodinger-supported version.
See http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymol/, http://www.pymolwiki.org,
http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Windows_Install,
http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/MAC_Install and
http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Linux_Install for additional options

5.  Use the standard PyMOL Plugin manager to install autodock.py from this kit
as a plugin.

6.  Several enviroment variables may be set to simplify configuration:

    ADPLUGIN_PATH  -- the contents of this variable with be copied to PATH
before executing threads and processes from the script.  You should put
paths for the internal MGLTools version of python, as well as for autodock4,
autogrid4 and vina _before_ the other path elements appropriate for your system.
Then you can use these program names without paths in the configuration.

    ADPLUGIN_PYTHONHOME, ADPLUGIN_PYTHONPATH  -- the contents of these variables
will be copied to PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH before executing threads and
processes from the script.  You should set these to values appropriate for the
MGLTools version of python, which may otherwise conflict with the system version
you use to start PyMOL

    ADPLUGIN_FONT -- the contents of this variable may be used to override the
default "Courier 10" font used by the plugin

7.  In configuring AutoDockTools  Utilities24 configuration entry, you are giving
a path to various python scripts.  It is important that your system process these
scripts with the correct version of python from MGLTools.  It helps to prefix
the path with "python " and set ADPLUGIN_PATH, ADPLUGIN_PYTHONHOME,  and
ADPLUGIN_PYTHONPATH to values that with point to the MGLTools copy of python.
For example in a Mac MGLTools 1.5.7rc1 installation, appropriate lines to place
in .bashrc would be

export ADPLUGIN_PATH=/Library/MGLTools/1.5.7rc1/bin:$PATH
export ADPLUGIN_PYTHONHOME=/Library/MGLTools/1.5.7rc1
export ADPLUGIN_PYTHONPATH=/Library/MGLTools/1.5.7rc1/MGLToolsPckgs:/Library/MGLTools/1.5.7rc1/lib/python2.7
